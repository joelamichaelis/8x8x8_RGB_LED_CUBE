   </Expansion>
   <Description>
      A technique used to control corrosion of a metal structure or surface by introducing an anode to create an electrochemical cell in which the metal structure or surface to be protected is rendered the cathode. There are two types of systems for cathodic protection: sacrificial anode systems and impressed current systems. In each system, the anode possesses a lower electrochemical potential than the cathode (and is thus more corrodible), prompting the corrosion-causing current to flow away from the anode, rather than the cathode. For example, cathodic protection is used to control corrosion of boat hulls, underground storage tanks, home water heaters, and steel water and fuel pipelines. In some industries, governments require regular testing and inspection of cathodic protection systems to ensure proper operation.

      MPLS
   </Acronym>
   <Expansion>
      MultiProtocol Label Switching
   </Expansion>
   <Description>
      A mechanism in high-performance telecommunications networks that directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses. This saves the time needed for a router to look up the address of the next node to forward the packet to. MPLS is called multiprotocol because it works with the Internet Protocol (IP), Asynchronous Transport Mode (ATM), and frame relay network protocols.
